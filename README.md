# BUDS – Community Learning and Volunteer Verification Platform

## Project Overview

BUDS is a free, web-based learning exchange platform that connects volunteer educators, learners, and universities in a single, unified system. The platform enables volunteers to teach or tutor, provides learners with high-quality educational support at no cost, and allows universities to reliably verify and recognize volunteer hours.

## Problem Statement

There is no unified, accessible platform that connects volunteer educators, learners, and universities. Students struggle to find meaningful volunteer roles, universities lack efficient tools to verify volunteer hours, learners have limited free educational support, and existing platforms focus on profit rather than community impact.

## Key Features

- **Volunteer Educator Network**: Connect educators willing to teach and mentor
- **Learner Access**: Provide free educational support to those in need
- **Hour Verification**: Official tracking and verification system for universities
- **Scalable Design**: Built to support diverse and growing user communities
- **Community-Focused**: Emphasis on accessibility and social impact
