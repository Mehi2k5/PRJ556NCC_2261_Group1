Course
PRJ566 – Software Engineering Project
Term: Winter 2026
Section: NCC
Repository Name: PRJ566NCC_2261_Group#
📌 Project Overview
BUDS is a free, web-based platform designed to connect volunteer educators, learners, and universities within a single unified system. The platform enables learners to access free educational support, allows volunteers to teach or mentor, and provides institutions with a reliable way to track and verify volunteer hours.
The goal of BUDS is to promote community learning, accessibility, and official recognition of volunteer contributions.
🎯 Problem Statement
There is currently no centralized platform that:
Connects volunteer educators with learners
Helps students find meaningful volunteer teaching roles
Allows universities to officially verify volunteer hours
Existing solutions either focus only on learning content or only on volunteer tracking, lacking integration and community impact.
🚀 Project Vision
BUDS aims to:
Provide a centralized volunteer learning ecosystem
Enable verified volunteer hour tracking
Support free, accessible education
Scale for universities and communities
